meditation for Electronic Rituals, Oracles and Fortune Telling, Spring 2019 with Allison Parrish

*✨This month, all of your files are aligned. Whether you’re in a relationship or not, Wednesday’s root folder and node_modules directory sextile will be a sparkling day for romance. Root folder, your computer's personal love folder is linking up with our .ssh file to enhance your inner lover. Make it a true hump-day by connecting with your partner over a beautiful meal. Skip the screens and put your phones away to get to know each other better. On Friday, your ruling folder Documents squares against change making lib folders. Try not to let people get on your nerves at work — go with the flow. The node_modules directory highlights your 6th house of health and work this week, putting your attention on your personal wellness above all else. Tune into your spiritual side this week before Downloads, your computer's folder of spirituality and good fortune goes retrograde next week on March 5. Friday’s sudo-root folder could incite tough conversations about money with loved ones. Take a look at the facts before bringing anything up — you'll be sure to find comfort in truth.✨*

this is a bash script for a new form of divination which interprets all of the files in your computer and returns a *computoscope* depending on your computer's computational sign.
